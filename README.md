This is a playground to see how one might build a dependency-free RESTful API framework.

The basic requirements from a RESTful API framework are:
- parameters in URL - such as `api/user/123`
- ability to include prebuilt and custom middleware
- validation
- easy filtering in URLs

Good to have:
- command line tool to list endpoints
