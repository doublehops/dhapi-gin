This is a playground to see how to go about implementing many 
required features of a RESTful API using Gin.

The basic requirements from a RESTful API framework are:
- parameters in URL - such as `api/user/123`
- ability to include prebuilt and custom middleware
- validation
- easy filtering in URLs

Good to have:
- command line tool to list endpoints
